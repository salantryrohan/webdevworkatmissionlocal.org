Mission Local is a project of U.C. Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism. Mission Local believes that by covering a neighborhood fairly and thoroughly, we can build community and a sustainable model for quality journalism. We’re a mix of students, professionals and community members. I am the primary web developer for the application.

I work with professor Lydia Chavez and other students from the school of journalism to implement custom php pages and plugin’s to drive user engagement and increase viewership of the site missionlocal.org

Some of the the projects I have worked on include :

SNAPS: Provides an easy mechanism for users of the missionlocal site to upload images. The images then go through an approval process and get published. This is one the most visited and socially shared aspects of the website.

Events: Displays a automatically updated events on the home page. We allow users to create events, It pulls data from the existing events. Users can also go and check a dedicated events page and filter with category, price and date’s. Built as a custom plug-in which can dragged and dropped as a widget.

Volunteer page: nonprofits can register themselves with us, create volunteer events. Users can search for specific events and decide to volunteer. Created using custom php templates.


Moving-mural’s contest: User submitted bus murals, I had to figure out a way to provide an easy interface and a mechanism for the page to go social.
